Retrieving the Element:
The code uses document.getElementById('target-div') to obtain the DOM element with the ID "target-div". This element will be manipulated to achieve the desired visual changes.

Storing the Element:
The retrieved element is stored in a variable named targetElement for further manipulation. This improves code readability and maintainability.

The targetElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow' line sets the background color of the element to yellow.

Margin:
The targetElement.style.margin = '20px' line adds a 20-pixel margin around the element, creating space between it and other elements.

Padding:
The targetElement.style.padding = '10px' line adds a 10-pixel padding within the element, creating space between the content and its borders.

Font Size and Weight:
The targetElement.style.fontSize = '18px' line sets the font size to 18 pixels for better readability.

The targetElement.style.fontWeight = 'bold' line makes the font bold, emphasizing the content.
